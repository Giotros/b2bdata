# LinkedIn Post - B2B Data Tracker

---

**Have you ever felt late in sales?**

With this tool, you'll never be late again.

Introducing **b2bdata.net** → my first baby 🚀

**What it does:**
Track the products that are MOVING in your supplier's catalog. Find hot sellers before your competition does.

**The mechanism is simple:**
1. Paste your supplier's XML feed → Generate snapshot (.json)
2. Wait a few days
3. Paste the new feed → Compare snapshots
4. Discover which products are selling like crazy

**Real example:**
→ Product A: Stock dropped 80% in 6 days (hot seller!)
→ Product B: Price dropped $20 (better margin for you)
→ Product C: Down to last unit (reorder alert)

**2 MASSIVE Business Benefits:**

✅ **Access to supplier data** – Turn raw XML feeds into actionable intelligence. See price changes, inventory levels, and new product launches instantly.

✅ **Usable data to fight competition** – Know what's selling BEFORE your competitors do. Stock hot products early, catch price drops fast, identify market trends.

**Tech Stack (for the devs):**
→ React 18 + Vite (blazing fast builds, HMR)
→ TailwindCSS (utility-first styling)
→ Recharts (data visualization)
→ DOMParser API (client-side XML parsing, no backend needed)
→ Vercel + Vercel KV (Redis for analytics persistence)
→ React Router DOM v6 (SPA routing)
→ Privacy-first analytics (self-hosted, GDPR-friendly)

**Why it matters:**
No setup. No uploads to third-party servers. All processing happens in YOUR browser. Free forever.

The tool started for e-commerce, but the comparison engine? Works for any time-series data. I'm perfecting the B2B use case first, then expanding to weather data, geographic metrics, financial trends.
